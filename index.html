    <h1>Capstone Portfolio: Ozora Smart Dining Platform</h1>
    <p>
        The Ozora Smart Dining Platform is a digital restaurant system designed to improve the dining experience through
        intuitive UI/UX design, scalable backend architecture, and efficient ordering workflows. This portfolio documents
        the evolution of the project across multiple quarters, highlighting applied learning, technical decisions,
        stakeholder feedback, and reflective growth throughout the capstone process.

    <h2>Portfolio Purpose</h2>
    <p>
        This digital portfolio showcases the development journey of my capstone project from initial concept to iterative
        implementation. It is designed for both academic evaluation and professional presentation to demonstrate applied
        software engineering skills, problem-solving, and continuous learning.
